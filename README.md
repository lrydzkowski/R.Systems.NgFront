# R.Systems.Web

Angular web application which will play the role of web frontend for my different ideas connected with creating software.
The whole system is called R.Systems and according to my current plans the first version will have the following modules:

- UsersManagement - Everything connected with user authentication, authorization and management.
- [Lexica](https://github.com/lrydzkowski/Lexica) - Web version of my different project which is English learning software focused on
